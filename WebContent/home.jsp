			<h3>1.PRESIDENT OF INDIA:-</h3>
		</div>
		<br> <br> <br> The President of India is the head of
		the executive, legislature and judiciary of the country. Article 52 of
		the Constitution of India says that there should <br>be a
		President of India. Article 53 says that all the executive powers of
		the Union shall be exercised by him either directly or through
		officers subordinate<br> to him. <br> <br>
		<div class="col-md-7 wlcome-grid-left">
			<h3>2. Vice President of India:-</h3>
		</div>
		<br> <br> <br>The office of the Vice President of India
		is the second highest constitutional office in India after the
		commander-in-chief of the Indian Armed Forces.<br> Also, the Vice
		President of India is the ex-officio chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.
		An electoral college consisting of the members of both the Houses of <br>
		Parliament- the Upper House i.e. Rajya Sabha and the Lower House i.e.
		Lok Sabha, elects the Vice President of India in accordance with the
		system of proportional representation by means of single transferable
		vote. The voting in such election is by secret ballot which is
		conducted by the Election <br>Commission. The Vice President of
		India is not a member of any House of Parliament or of a House of a
		Legislature of a State. The term of the office <br>of Vice
		President is five years. <br> <br>
		<div class="col-md-7 wlcome-grid-left">
			<h3>3. Prime Minister of India:-</h3>
		</div>
		<br> <br> <br>The Prime Minister of India is the head
		of the executive branch of the Government of India. His position is
		distinct from that <br> of the President of India, who is the
		head of the State. As India follows a parliamentary system of
		government modelled after the Westminster system,<br> most of the
		executive powers are exercised by the Prime Minister. He acts as an
		advisor to the President and is the leader of the Council of
		Ministers.<br> The President appoints the Prime Minister of India
		and on his advice, appoints the Council of Ministers. The Prime
		Minister can be a member of either<br> the Lok Sabha or the Rajya
		Sabha. <br> <br>
		<div class="col-md-7 wlcome-grid-left">
			<h3>4.the Indian Parliament:-</h3>
		</div>
		<br> <br> <br>The Parliament of India is the supreme
		legislative authority in the country and it is bicameral. It is
		divided into two houses the Rajya Sabha, which is the <br>
		Council of States, and the Lok Sabha, which is the House of the
		People. <br>The Lok Sabha is referred to as the Lower house and
		the Rajya Sabha is referred to as the Upper house. The members of the
		Parliament are either<br> elected by the people of India or
		nominated by the President of India. <br> <br>

			<h3>6.Governor of India:-</h3>
		</div>
		<br> <br> <br> The Governor is the head of a state just
		like the President is the head of the republic. The Governor is the
		nominal head of a state, while the Chief Minister <br> is the
		executive head. <br>All executive actions of the state are taken
		in the name of the Governor. However, in reality he merely gives his
		consent to the various executive actions.<br> He or she is devoid
		of taking any major decisions. The real powers in the executive
		dealings of a state rest with the Chief Minister and the Council <br>of
		Ministers. <br>
